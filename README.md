# Morse_Code
This Python project is a simple Morse code converter. It allows users to encode plain text into Morse code and decode Morse code back into plain text. Morse code is a method used in telecommunication to encode text characters as sequences of two different signal durations, called dots and dashes or dits and dahs.
